When working on this deliverable, I learned how important wireframes and sitemaps are when designing a website. Creating a sitemap before designing a website provides many different benefits. Think of a sitemap as like a blueprint for your website. A sitemap allows you to prioritize what content and pages are most important. By visually presenting all of your site content to the user, it’s easier to talk about how user flow matches with website goals. Wireframes show the construction of individual pages of your website. Wireframes give your team or developing partner a preview of the content blocks, features, and functionality of each page. They start to hint at overall page layout but don’t include design elements. Used together, wireframes and sitemaps give developers a slight advantage when it comes time to build the website as it gives a preview of how the website will look visually as well as how the website is going to function.
